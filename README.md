## Description

The Meal Finder App is a web application that allows users to search for meals or generate random meals using the themealdb.com API. The app provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter a search term or click a button to generate a random meal. The app then connects to the API and retrieves the relevant meals based on the user's input.

Once the meals are fetched from the API, they are displayed in the DOM with images and a hover effect. Users can hover over the meal images to view the meal title. Clicking on a meal will display the details of that meal, including the title, image, categories, instructions/recipe, and ingredients with measurements.

The app also includes a documentation page that provides information about the different API endpoints available. Users can explore the various endpoints to retrieve specific types of meals based on their preferences.
